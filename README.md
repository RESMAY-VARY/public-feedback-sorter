## 💡 The "Why"
This project was born out of a real-world frustration seen in local government meetings (inspired by experiences in Corpus Christi, TX). In many public forums, legitimate citizen requests and helpful ideas often get "miscategorized" or ignored because they are drowned out by loud personal attacks or disorganized feedback streams.

**FeedbackFlow AI** was built to solve this by using intelligence to look past the tone and find the **intent**. It ensures that a citizen asking for a favor or reporting a problem is given the same priority as any other stakeholder, while protecting staff from harassment.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ Compliance & Policy Shield
Automatically detects and flags verbal attacks or personal insults. These are blurred and tagged as **"Pending Policy Review,"** keeping the focus on productive discourse while maintaining a professional environment.

### 🎯 Priority Review Queue (The "Human" Control)
AI isn't perfect, so we built a **Long-Press** mechanism. If a human sees a critical insight that the AI missed, they can hold down on the card to flag it instantly for the **Priority Review Queue**.

### 📊 Community Pulse Metrics
Real-time analytics for decision-makers:
- **Noise Reduction %:** See exactly how many duplicates the AI has handled for you.
- **Sentiment Spectrum:** An instant "vibe check" of the current public forum.
- **Enterprise Terminologies:** Data is categorized into professional sectors like *Operational Efficiency* and *Technical Assistance*.

### ⚡ Big Data Performance
Built to handle a "Corpus Christi-sized" community. Using **Infinite Scroll** and **Optimized Lookups (Sets)**, the app stays lightning-fast even with 10,000+ entries.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS, CSS3, HTML5
- **Aesthetics:** Modern "Enterprise Dark Mode" with Glassmorphism
- **Management:** GitHub Pages for global deployment

## 👨‍💻 Created with a Mission
I'm a new creator on GitHub, but I'm here because I believe technology can help us understand each other better. If you're a developer or a local government official, I hope this project shows you what's possible when we prioritize **clear intentions** over loud noise.

*Built with ❤️ for a more heard community.*
